## Descripción

A type of transposition cipher is the rail fence cipher, which is described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_fence_cipher). Here is one such cipher encrypted using the rail fence with 4 rails. Can you decrypt it? Download the message [here](https://challenge-files.cylabacademy.net/library/54f070d7a4fbb401b7ae06e5f41a3071cc195039368a58d9c6bb6f5a95b7913c/message.txt).

The decoded message names a phrase. Put that phrase, and nothing else, in the academy flag format: `academy{phrase}`.

1.- Once you've understood how the cipher works, it's best to draw it out yourself on paper
