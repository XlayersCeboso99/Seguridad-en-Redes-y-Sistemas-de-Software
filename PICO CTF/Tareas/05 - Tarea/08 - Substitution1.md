A second message has come in the mail, and it seems almost identical to the first one. Maybe the same thing will work again. Download the message [here](https://challenge-files.cylabacademy.net/library/ceba1af4dd4ee542c226922acd536495ebe14c328fb6766ae3244de7d7deaa2e/message.txt).

1.- Try a frequency attack

2.- Do the punctuation and the individual words help you make any substitutions?

CTFs (short for capture the flag) are a type of computer security competition. Contestants are presented with a set of challenges which test their creativity, technical (and googling) skills, and problem-solving ability. Challenges usually cover a number of categories, and when solved, each yields a string (called a flag) which is submitted to an online scoring service. CTFs are a great way to learn a wide array of computer security skills in a safe, legal environment, and are hosted and played by many security groups around the world for fun and practice. For this problem, the flag is: academy{FR3QU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_26A742EB}

Bandera: academy{FR3QU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_26A742EB}
